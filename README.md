# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

**Primary Learning Objectives:**
1. Creating and iteratively refining a regression model
2. Using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to practice the modeling process
3. Providing business insights through reporting and presentation.

Goal
It is my job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, I must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

Evaluation
Kaggle leaderboard standings will be determined by root mean squared error (RMSE).

## Tech Used
- Python
- Scikit Learn 
- Seaborn 

## The Data
NAME: AmesHousing.txt
TYPE: Population
SIZE: 2930 observations, 82 variables
-Data set contains information from the Ames Assessorâ€™s Office used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010.

-The data has 82 columns which include 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous variables (and 2 additional observation identifiers).

## Problem Statement

Null Hype Realty Group have hit a slump in sales recently and seem to be losing traction in the market. They have surmised that their pricing model is outdated and have hired us to come up with a more competitive one. Our goal is to analyze the Ames Housing data set to and use regression modeling to create a model that more accurately predicts the current market value for potential clients. 

## Conclusion

I was able to use linear regression to create a model that can explain 87% of market variance and accurately evaluate a property's worth in Ames Iowa to within 25_000 USD.
